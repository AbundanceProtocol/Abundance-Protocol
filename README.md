# Abundance Protocol
The Abundance Protocol strives to expand the scope of the economy, so that everyone can make a living by making meaningful contributions to society - even when these contributions are not properly valued within the market economy.

The Protocol creates a sustainable economic paradigm for public goods (open source projects, scientific research, and all digital content) where projects are valued based on their impact and credibility. see project White Paper for a detailed explanation of the mechanism: https://buildingweb4.io/white-paper/

The Protocol is currently in early stages of testing on the Mumbai (Polygon) testnet and can be viewed at https://buildingweb4.io
